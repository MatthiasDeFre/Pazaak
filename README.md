# Pazaak

## Description

For our first year assignment we needed to make the game Pazaak. Pazaak is a card game situated in the Star Wars universe.
First we needed to make a console application and later a JavaFX version using the same underlying code.
Below you can also find a video gameplay of our version of the game. At the moment the game uses a local database connection so if you would want to try the game yourself you can send me an email at matthiasdefre@hotmail.com and I will send the database SQL script.

### My role within the team

During the project I was the teamleader, we all decided that I would be the one taking that position. Although I was the teamleader all team members still had a free choice of what to do, I was there to make sure everything got finished in time and that the quality was good.
I also was the main programmer, this meant that I did most of the main gameplay code and database communication. We also organised weekly sessions to explain the code to eachother so everybody knew what each piece of code did.
